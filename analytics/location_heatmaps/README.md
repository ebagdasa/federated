# Towards Sparse Federated Analytics: Location Heatmaps under Distributed Differential Privacy with Secure Aggregation

This directory contains code to experiment with differential
privacy on location heatmaps and based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02356).
Here is the example of the algorithm running on NYC location map from 
[NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/reader-center/phone-data-location-investigation.html):

To experiment with the code there is a working [notebook](dp_location_heatmaps.ipynb) 
with all the examples from the paper, please don't hesitate to contact the 
[author](mailto:eugene@cs.cornell.edu) or raise an issue.1
